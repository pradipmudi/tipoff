## What
Tipoff is an open source, flexible, private cloud or on-prem front-end monitoring platform that auto notifies the developers based on the preconfigured Tips it receives from the end-user browser.

It is created using the MERN stack. You can visit the complete stack [here]([https://stackshare.io/tipoff/tipoff](https://stackshare.io/tipoff/tipoff)).

## Why
Tipoff helps you identify and fix bugs faster. You **get notified in realtime** before your customers notify you.

It gives you the flexibility to **keep the customer's data on your own servers** with complete control over securing and processing the data however you want. You don't need to worry about any third-party entity prying your customer's sensitive information.
